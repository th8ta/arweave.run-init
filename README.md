# Initialization Script for arweave.run

This script automatically runs whenever arweave.run clears its database and restarts.

arweave.run is a testnet, **not** a replacement to Arweave, so a restart operation should be expected. 

## Contributing

If you have any contracts or data that needs to be on the testnet at all times, feel free to submit a PR after editing `src/index.ts`.
